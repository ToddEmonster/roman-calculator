There are some rules to a Roman number:

+ Numerals can be concatenated to form a larger numeral (“XX” + “II” = “XXII”)
+ If a lesser numeral is put before a bigger it means subtraction of the lesser from the bigger (“IV” means four, “CM” means ninehundred)
+ If the numeral is I, X or C you can’t have more than three (“II” + “II” = “IV”)
+ If the numeral is V, L or D you can’t have more than one (“D” + “D” = “M”)
